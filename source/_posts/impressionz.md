Since I arrived without a smartphone, I haven't been taking many pictures. I hope I can make up for it while getting done some touristy must do's in the next couple weeks.

Impressions you get from the slideshow **(click the picture above and use arrow keys or touch the picture on a mobile device)** are based on:
- commuting to RC
- walking in Prospect Park, a small green oasis in the urban jungle of Brooklyn
- acquiring a silk Kimono from at the Chelsea Flea Market. (finally! x3)
- an awesome avocado store in Chinatown which only sells one type of avocado, and I mean ONLY.
- Brooklyn Brick Oven pizza baking (Meetup)
- People at Union Square wanting to talk me into voting for Bernie.
- taking the staten island ferry (for free!) at sunset.
- taking the train home from times square.
